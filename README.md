# Final Project DAT-129

### Project Overview

My project uses the CryptoCompare API
1. It grabs the top 10 coins for the current day
2. Get their highest price
3. Compares the price of the coin with the previous price for each day
4. Counts how many coins rise and fall per day
5. Displays a datafram showing the dates with all the coins and their percentages
    - also shows how many coins went up or down that day by %5 and %10

(this is not the same data set at the dataframe above. I reached a rate limit for the api before this printed)
